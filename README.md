The IPL Data Analysis project aims to explore historical match data to uncover key insights about team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes. By using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we clean, analyze, and visualize data to identify trends such as the most successful teams, top players, and win margins. This project helps in understanding IPL dynamics through data-driven insights and can be extended to predictive modeling for match outcomes.
